# framework_test

## Task 1: software configuration.
 
### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I decided to participate in the project because I want to get a new high-paying job.
Desire to gain new knowledge in testing. Get theoretical and practical knowledge.
Complete all tasks productively and get an internship in the team. 

### Good luck!
